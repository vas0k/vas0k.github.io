# About Me

I work as an Application Security Engineer dealing with "Shift Left" security, which basically means dealing with security issues as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC), with minimal cost overhead. In a nutshell, this includes running tests to check the security posture of applications, and conveying issues found to upper management in a timely manner.

_I am in no way an expert in this vast field of IT and Computer Security. However, I strive to the best of my ability, to share technology concepts in a non-technical way to the wider audience._

# What's in it for you?

This blog is aimed at discussing technology topics. If you are a computer science student, IT engineer or if you're interested in pursuing a career in IT/Computer Security, there will be something in this blog for you. As mentioned, I try to make technology concepts as easy to digest as possible, so that even non-technical folks can benefit from this blog.

This blog is split up into various categories, to make it easier for people to search for content.
