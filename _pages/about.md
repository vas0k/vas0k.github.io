# About Me

I work as an Application Security Engineer dealing with "Shift Left" security, which basically means dealing with security issues as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC), with minimal cost overhead. In a nutshell, this includes running tests to check the security posture of applications, and conveying issues found to upper management in a timely manner.

_I am in no way an expert in this vast field of IT and Computer Security. However, I strive to the best of my ability, to share technology concepts in a non-technical way to the wider audience._
