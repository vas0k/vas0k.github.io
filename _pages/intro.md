Hello everyone, and welcome to my blog. I'm a Security engineer who loves programming and automating stuff.

### What's in it for you?

I blog about technology topics. If you are a computer science student, IT engineer or if you're interested in pursuing a career in IT/Computer Security, there will be something in this blog for you.

Also, I try to make technology concepts digestible for less-technical folks.
